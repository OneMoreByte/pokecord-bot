# Pokecord bot

I made a simple bot that I ran for a short while to generate pokemon spawns, where I could reliably catch them without worring about friends or random folks on the internet being better at typing than I was.

I stopped running it when my interest in pokecord waned, but I didn't want to upload it because I was fearful it would be hard on the pokecord bot if people stumbled upon it and ran it en-mass.

Now that it's shutting down, I feel this bot can be put on github to store perpetually.
